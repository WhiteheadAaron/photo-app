# Photo App

This app is to view photos from the albums contained at https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos


### Getting Started

When you clone the repository, use the 'yarn' command in the project directory to download the necessary dependencies. Then run 'yarn start' and the app should launch in your browser automatically.

### App Details

When you first get to the app, you will notice 100 boxes ordered by number that are all clickable. When you click on a number, you will open up that album of photos. It will show you every photo's id, title, and thumbnail as well as a link to the original image. If you wish to select a different album, click on the button towards the top of the screen and it will take you back to the main page to make a new selection.

### Testing

I made unit tests for every component and function in the app. If you run 'yarn test' in the console, it will run the tests for you. You can also run 'yarn test:coverage' to see that the tests cover 100% of lines in the application.
